The post introduces a project where the Llama-8B model is trained via reinforcement learning (using a modified version of Unsloth's GRPO code) to develop its own research skills through self-play. By generating questions about documents, searching for answers, and learning from its mistakes, the model significantly improved its performance—from 23% accuracy on Apollo 13 mission report questions to 53% within just an hour of training. The project operates entirely locally with open-source models, marking an innovative approach to teaching language models to manage and improve their interactions with data.

Key technical details include the model’s ability to gradually refine its search queries and reduce hallucinations, effectively learning meta-skills that enhance its reasoning and use of tools rather than memorizing specific data. The discussion highlights that once the model masters the low-hanging fruit, such as correct function calls, further learning slows down, raising questions about the long-term training benefits and potential plateauing in performance. The project acts as a framework to optimize an LLM's interface over a dataset, suggesting that end-to-end reinforcement learning of entire agent pipelines could boost the reliability of language models.
