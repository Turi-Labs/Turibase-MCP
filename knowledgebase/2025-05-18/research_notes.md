The article "AI models can't tell time or read a calendar, study reveals" (https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-models-cant-tell-time-or-read-a-calendar-study-reveals) highlights the growing concern that advanced AI models struggle with accurately reading clocks and calendars. The findings indicate that while models like Gemma-2-27Bit can generally identify the positions of clock hands, they often confuse the hour and minute indicators, ignore or misinterpret the second hand, and sometimes err in converting or recognizing time zones. The study also notes challenges in tracking days of the week, emphasizing that these limitations stem from the models’ reliance on static training data rather than real-time information.

Furthermore, community feedback underscores that AI's inability to update or access current external sources of time-data—akin to being “in a windowless room”—exacerbates these issues. Observers pointed out that while humans have the means to check digital clocks or calendars, AI models are confined to outdated knowledge and, therefore, offer inaccurate answers when asked about the current time or date. This disconnect not only affects clock-reading capabilities but also highlights broader limitations in time-sensitive tasks, suggesting a need for integrating external, real-time data sources to improve performance.

OpenAI is planning to construct a massive data center in Abu Dhabi, with its scale projected to be larger than the entire area of Monaco. The project raises significant technical and logistical questions, particularly concerning the sourcing of power and the management of cooling processes in a challenging climate. Concerns have been raised by some commentators about the feasibility of efficiently cooling such a large facility in an environment that may not be naturally conducive to advanced thermal management.

Additional remarks note that while alternative locations like Texas and Arizona have been considered for their favorable climatic conditions and the cost benefits arising from dry air, Abu Dhabi’s status as a petrostate offers the distinct advantage of cheaper energy supplies. This factor may help mitigate some of the logistical difficulties associated with powering and cooling the center.

This paper examines how large language model (LLM) populations, when set up in an abstract game that rewards agreement and punishes deviation, tend to converge on uniform responses, suggesting the emergence of social conventions and collective bias among these models. The study investigates the dynamics of these interactions, questioning whether the observed homogenization is unique to LLMs or if it would also occur in simpler, non-LLM systems. Such a convergence—where agents effectively “agree” due to the reward structure—is compared to phenomena like the self-synchronization of metronomes, raising a debate on whether these results point to inherent collective biases or are merely a trivial artifact of the simulation setup.

Furthermore, the discussion highlights a range of reactions from commentators, some of whom are skeptical and liken the findings to well-known synchronization effects in physical systems, while others find the emergence of online-like social interactions (such as trendsetting and manipulation campaigns) compelling. The paper prompts further inquiry into the broader implications of such emergent behaviors, including potential impacts on online discourse and digital manipulation, and encourages exploration into whether this phenomenon could be leveraged to test economic or sociocultural theories.

The project “Show HN: I modeled the Voynich Manuscript with SBERT to test for structure” applies natural language processing techniques to the enigmatic Voynich Manuscript, a 15th-century text written in an unknown script. Rather than aiming to translate the text, the creator used SBERT embeddings along with KMeans clustering to investigate whether the manuscript exhibits structured language properties. A key preprocessing step involved stripping common suffix-like endings to isolate potential root forms, which aided in revealing inherent syntactic clusters. The analysis included inferring parts-of-speech roles based on the positions and frequencies of word clusters, as well as constructing a Markov transition matrix to visualize the flow between clusters, ultimately indicating consistent internal syntax across different manuscript sections (e.g., botanical and biological).

The technical approach leverages current NLP methods to model structure in a text whose language remains unsolved, thereby opening avenues for understanding whether the manuscript is a genuine language, a cipher, or even a hoax. Discussions in the accompanying thread highlight alternative dimensionality reduction techniques like PaCMAP, UMAP, or t-SNE that could further enhance the analysis, as well as potential upgrades to embedding models for improved results. This work is significant as it demonstrates that even without direct translation, modern computational techniques can uncover structured linguistic patterns in mysterious texts.

K-Scale Labs, founded by Ben, has announced an open-source initiative to democratize humanoid robotics by providing a reinforcement learning library and a sim2real pipeline for training humanoid policies in Python. This initiative addresses the challenges of expensive, proprietary, and limited SDK-based humanoid options by leveraging off-the-shelf components to build a flexible, developer-friendly robot. The project enables users to quickly try out the software—with setup instructions provided (cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and running training)—and even offers an option to have trained models run on physical robots through a benchmarking platform, highlighting the company's goal of creating a white-box system for universal developer use.

Technically, the project simplifies the process of training humanoid policies and emphasizes the ease of swapping out hardware components (such as hands and feet) to suit different application needs. The underlying vision is to drastically lower the barrier for experimenting with humanoid robotics, paralleling transformative software frameworks like CUDA and PyTorch, thereby fostering a collaborative ecosystem. This approach is intended to accelerate innovation in robotics and contribute to a more distributive, accessible future.

The announcement introduces model2vec-rs, a new Rust crate designed for fast, static text embeddings without any Python dependency. The tool allows developers to easily load Model2Vec models from Hugging Face or local paths, providing high throughput for various use cases such as semantic search, retrieval, and retrieval-augmented generation. With a tiny footprint (around 1.7 MB for the crate and 7–30 MB for embedding models), initial benchmarks indicate that Rust can process approximately 8,000 embeddings per second, outperforming a Python implementation by about 1.7× speedup on a CPU in a single-threaded setup.

In addition to the core functionality, the discussion highlights handling of text longer than the model's context length by splitting input into sentences, though some community members raised concerns about the method’s semantic appropriateness. Comments also compared static text embeddings to attention-based models, noting that while some tradeoffs in embedding quality exist, the efficiency gains are significant—up to 70x faster performance particularly in CPU environments. More detailed benchmarks and model comparisons can be found here: https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec-rs.

Summary 7:
A recent study highlighted on Live Science reveals that despite their advanced language capabilities, AI models struggle with time-related tasks such as reading a calendar or determining specific dates without external calculations. The research suggests that while popular large language models (LLMs) can handle questions like "what’s the 153rd day of the year 2025" by relying on calculated data, they often falter when questions require a deeper understanding of time, indicating a significant gap in their intrinsic reasoning abilities.

The study’s findings have sparked mixed reactions, with some critics pointing out that tasks like calendar calculations are directly computable and should be within the capabilities of AI if programmed with the correct data. Other comments noted the irony that while these models may be proficient in educational tasks, they can’t perform basic real-world time-telling functions. This underscores a potential limitation in current AI architectures concerning temporal reasoning.
